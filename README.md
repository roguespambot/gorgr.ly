gorgr.ly
========

Gorgr.ly is a project I worked on at the Epicodus bootcamp. It is a restaurant point-of-sale app, where servers can assign foods to meals, meals to tables, and then have the app add up a table's bill.

It was built as an introduction to the Ember.js framework. My pair and I became stuck at an attempt to understand how to use nested routes in Ember.
